# Show Me the Pics (A simple web application for users to return public pictures of a flickr user by entering their user ID)

The project is a part of the Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/). I use it to practice my skills of using Ruby on Rails, especially with using APIs.

A detailed description of the project is here: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/flickr-api

I have deployed the project to Heroku: https://nameless-island-19381.herokuapp.com/

## Currently Implemented Features

So far, I have implemented the following features:

1. Use figaro gem (https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro) to safely store sensitive information.
2. Add 10 sample flickr User IDs for users to try out the web application.


## Todos

1. Use React to add better stylings
